# Express.js Routing Example

This repository contains a simple Express.js application demonstrating routing using Node.js. It sets up routes for rendering different views and handling dynamic parameters.

## Express.js Routing

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. One of the key features of Express.js is its routing mechanism, which allows developers to define routes for handling different HTTP requests and serving content to clients.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Code Explanation

### Dependencies Used

- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templating engine that allows generating HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

### Code Structure

- **app.js**: Entry point of the application where Express.js setup and routes are defined.
- **views/**: Directory containing EJS templates for rendering HTML content.
- **public/**: Directory for serving static files like CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.

### Routing

Routing refers to the process of determining how an application responds to client requests to a particular endpoint. In this Express.js application:

- The root endpoint `'/'` renders the `index.ejs` template.
- The `'/contact'` endpoint renders the `contact.ejs` template.
- The `'/profile/:username'` endpoint renders a dynamic profile page where `:username` is a route parameter passed in the URL.
